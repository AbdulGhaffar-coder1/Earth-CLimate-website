        <h3>The Shocking Truth About Plastic Waste and How You Can Help</h3>
        <p>“Every year, over 8 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the ocean. Learn how small actions can make a big difference.”</p>
        <p>Plastic pollution is one of the most significant environmental challenges we face today. From the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to the countless marine animals affected by plastic ingestion, the impact is devastating. However, we can all contribute to solving this issue.</p>
        
        <h4>What You Need to Know About Plastic Waste:</h4>
        <p>Plastic waste not only harms marine life but also disrupts entire ecosystems and poses health risks to humans. Microplastics, tiny plastic particles that result from the breakdown of larger plastic items, have been found in our food and drinking water.</p>
        
        <h4>How You Can Help:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reduce Single-Use Plastics:</strong> Opt for reusable bags, bottles, and containers to minimize plastic waste.</li>
          <li><strong>Participate in Clean-Up Initiatives:</strong> Join local beach or park clean-up events to remove plastic debris from the environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Educate Others:</strong> Share information about the effects of plastic waste and encourage others to make sustainable choices.</li>
          <li><strong>Support Legislation:</strong> Advocate for policies that aim to reduce plastic production and increase recycling efforts.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Every small action counts! By making conscious choices and spreading awareness, we can work together to combat plastic pollution and protect our planet for future generations.</p>
